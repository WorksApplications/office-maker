module Random.PCG.Interop where

{-| Provides a function to create a PCG seed from a seed in the core library.
This is useful for library writers who need a splittable or most robust PRNG but
don't want to require client code to use the PCG implementation.

```elm
import Random
import Random.PCG
import Random.PCG.Interop as Random.PCG

It seems that the package website doesn't show modules in type annotations, so here it is in full:

    fission : Random.Seed -> (Random.PCG.Seed, Random.Seed)

-}
fission : Random.Seed -> (Random.PCG.Seed, Random.Seed)
fission stdSeed0 =
  let
    gen = Random.int 0 0xFFFFFFFF
    (a, stdSeed1) = Random.generate gen stdSeed0
    (b, stdSeed2) = Random.generate gen stdSeed1
    pcgSeed1 = Random.PCG.initialSeed2 a b
  in
    (pcgSeed1, stdSeed2)
