# Random.PCG for Elm

An alternate random number generator. You can `import Random.PCG as Random` and everything will continue to
work (except [elm-random-extra](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/NoRedInk/elm-random-extra/latest/Random-Extra)).
This library offers two main improvements over core, without a large loss of performance (see `test/benchmark`):

* **Better statistical properties.** If you use any seed less than 53668 and generate one bool, it will be `True` â€“ if
you're using the core library. This library produces far less predictable output, especially if you use thousands of
random numbers. The core library fails after as little as five seconds of scrutiny. See `test/dieharder` for more
details.

* **More features.** This library exports `constant` and `andMap`, which are conspicuously absent from core. More
interesting is the `independentSeed` function which allows for lazy lists and isolated components to generate as much
randomness as they need, when they need it. There is also a `fastForward` function that allows random access (rather
than sequential access) into, effectively, an infinite array of random numbers. This can be used instead of reading a
finite amount of random values into a large data structure.

This is an implementation of [PCG](http://www.pcg-random.org/) by M. E. O'Neil, based on the [JS
port](https://github.com/thomcc/pcg-random) by Thom Chiovoloni (MIT license). The generator is **not cryptographically
secure**.
